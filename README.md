# Kobe M Thesis Title Page Style File

This is single style file for making the title of your master thesis for the Kobe University.

## Usage

1. First you need to edit this file directly. In this file, the commands `\xtitle`, `\xauthor`, `\xnumber` and `\xdate` are defined, which are the title of your master thesis, your name, your student id number and the date to submit the thesis.
You will clearly see how to edit these lines when you open this file ;)

2. Simply include this file in the preamble of your master thesis like

```
\include{thesistitle}
```
